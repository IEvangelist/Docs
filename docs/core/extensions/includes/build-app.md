To build the application from Visual Studio, select <kbd>F6</kbd> or select the **Build** > **Build Solution** menu option. If you're using the .NET CLI, run the `dotnet build` command from the working directory:

```dotnetcli
dotnet build
```

For more information on the .NET CLI build command, see [`dotnet build`](../../tools/dotnet-build.md).
