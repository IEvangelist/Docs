# Diagnostic libraries

Available as a set of .NET Extensions, various diagnostic libraries provide a set of APIs and tools that enable you to collect and analyze diagnostic information about your .NET applications. From summarizing exceptions, to determining resource utilization and monitoring, to exposing health checks, and providing probes for Kubernetes, the diagnostic packages provide a rich set of functionality that can be used to instrument your apps.

The following NuGet packages are available:

| NuGet package | Description |
|--|--|
| [ðŸ“¦ Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ExceptionSummarization](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ExceptionSummarization) | Provides a mechanism for retrieving exception summary information. |
| [ðŸ“¦ Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring) | Provides resource monitoring that measures processor and memory usage. |
| [ðŸ“¦ Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Common) | Provides a standard health check implementation, as well as host application lifetime hooks. |
| [ðŸ“¦ Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.ResourceUtilization](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.ResourceUtilization) | Provides resource utilization health checks. |
| [ðŸ“¦ Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Probes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Probes) | Provides support for Kubernetes environmental probes. |

## Exception summarization

When you're trying to generate meaningful diagnostic messages for exceptions, maintaining the inclusion of pertinent information can pose a challenge. The standard exception message often lacks critical details that accompany the exception, while invoking the <xref:System.Exception.ToString%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method yields an excess of state information.

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ExceptionSummarization.IExceptionSummarizer> interface offers methods for extracting crucial details from recognized exception types, thereby furnishing a singular `string` that serves as the foundation for crafting top-quality diagnostic messages.

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ExceptionSummarization.IExceptionSummarizer.Summarize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method systematically traverses the roster of registered summarizers until it identifies a summarizer capable of handling the specific exception type. In the event that no summarizer is capable of recognizing the exception type, a meaningful default exception summary is provided instead.

### Example exception summarization usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the `IExceptionSummarizer` interface to retrieve a summary of an exception.

:::code source="snippets/exception-summary/Program.cs":::

The preceding code:

- Instantiates a new <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceCollection> instance, chaining a call to the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ExceptionSummarization.ExceptionSummarizationExtensions.AddExceptionSummarizer%2A> extension method.
  - The `AddExceptionSummarizer` extension method accepts a delegate that is used to configure the `ExceptionSummarizerBuilder` instance.
  - The `builder` is used to add the HTTP provider, which handles exceptions of type:
    - <xref:System.OperationCanceledException>
    - <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException>
    - <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketException>
    - <xref:System.Net.WebException>
- Builds a new `ServiceProvider` instance from the `ServiceCollection` instance.
- Gets an instance of the `IExceptionSummarizer` interface from the `ServiceProvider` instance.
- Iterates over a collection of exceptions, calling the `Summarize` method on each exception and displaying the result.

> [!WARNING]
> The primary focus in the design of all exception summarization implementations is to provide diagnostic convenience to trusted users, rather than prioritizing the protection of personally identifiable information (PII). The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ExceptionSummarization.ExceptionSummary.Description?displayProperty=nameWithType> doesn't contain sensitive information, but the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ExceptionSummarization.ExceptionSummary.AdditionalDetails?displayProperty=nameWithType> might contain sensitive information depending on the implementation.

## Resource monitoring

Resource monitoring involves the continuous measurement of resource utilization over a specified period. The [Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring) NuGet package offers a collection of APIs tailored for monitoring the resource utilization of your .NET applications.

The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.IResourceMonitor> interface furnishes methods for retrieving real-time information concerning process resource utilization. This interface supports the retrieval of data related to CPU and memory usage and is currently compatible with both Windows and Linux platforms.

### Example resource monitoring usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the `IResourceMonitor` interface to retrieve information about the current process's CPU and memory usage.

:::code source="snippets/resource-monitoring/Program.cs" id="setup":::

The preceding code:

- Instantiates a new `ServiceCollection` instance, chaining calls to the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.LoggingServiceCollectionExtensions.AddLogging%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.ResourceMonitoringExtensions.AddResourceMonitoring%2A> extension methods.
- Builds a new `ServiceProvider` instance from the `ServiceCollection` instance.
- Gets an instance of the `IResourceMonitor` interface from the `ServiceProvider` instance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring?displayProperty=fullName> package assumes that the consumer will register logging providers with the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` package. If you don't register logging, the call to `AddResourceMonitoring` will throw an exception.

At this point, with the `IResourceMonitor` implementation you'll ask for resource utilization with the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.IResourceMonitor.GetUtilization%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. The `GetUtilization` method returns a <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.ResourceUtilization> instance that contains the following information:

- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.ResourceUtilization.CpuUsedPercentage?displayProperty=nameWithType>: CPU usage as a percentage.
- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.ResourceUtilization.MemoryUsedPercentage?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Memory usage as a percentage.
- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.ResourceUtilization.MemoryUsedInBytes?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Memory usage in bytes.
- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.ResourceUtilization.SystemResources?displayProperty=nameWithType>: System resources.
  - <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.SystemResources.GuaranteedMemoryInBytes?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Guaranteed memory in bytes.
  - <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.SystemResources.MaximumMemoryInBytes?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Maximum memory in bytes.
  - <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.SystemResources.GuaranteedCpuUnits?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Guaranteed CPU in units.
  - <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.SystemResources.MaximumCpuUnits?displayProperty=nameWithType>: Maximum CPU in units.

Extending this example, you can leverage [Spectre.Console](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Spectre.Console), a well-regarded .NET library designed to simplify the development of visually appealing, cross-platform console applications. With Spectre, you'll be able to present resource utilization data in a tabular format. The following code illustrates the usage of the `IResourceMonitor` interface to access details regarding the CPU and memory usage of the current process, then presenting this data in a table:

:::code source="snippets/resource-monitoring/Program.cs" id="monitor" highlight="30-31,36-40":::

The preceding code:

- Creates a cancellation token source and a cancellation token.
- Creates a new `Table` instance, configuring it with a title, caption, and columns.
- Performs a live render of the `Table` instance, passing in a delegate that will be invoked every three seconds.
- Gets the current resource utilization information from the `IResourceMonitor` instance and displays it as a new row in the `Table` instance.

The following is an example of the output from the preceding code:

:::image type="content" source="media/resource-monitoring-output.png" lightbox="media/resource-monitoring-output.png" alt-text="Example Resource Monitoring app output.":::

## Health checks

In a distributed system, health checks are periodic assessments of the status, availability, and performance of individual nodes or services. These checks ensure that the system functions correctly and efficiently. Health checks are essential for system reliability, and they are typically performed at regular intervals with the results analyzed for decision-making and corrective actions.

The following heath check status results are possible:

- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthStatus.Healthy?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthStatus.Degraded?displayProperty=nameWithType>
- <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthStatus.Unhealthy?displayProperty=nameWithType>

### Application lifetime health checks

To perform health checks on the application lifetime events of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime>, use the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.CommonHealthChecksExtensions.AddApplicationLifecycleHealthCheck%2A> extension method available in the [Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.Common) NuGet package.

This provider will indicate that the application is healthy only when it is fully active. Until the lifetime object indicates the application has started, the provider will report the application as not healthy. When the application starts shutting down, the provider will report the application as unhealthy.

In other words, this provider ensures that the application instance only receives traffic when it is fully active. Please consider the following example:

:::code source="snippets/lifetime-health-checks/Program.cs":::

The preceding code:

- Creates a new <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.HostApplicationBuilder> instance.
- Adds a health check for the application lifetime events of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime> by chaining a call from the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IHealthChecksBuilder> instance returned by the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.HealthCheckServiceCollectionExtensions.AddHealthChecks%2A> call to the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.CommonHealthChecksExtensions.AddApplicationLifecycleHealthCheck%2A> extension method.
- Builds the `IHost` instance.
- Gets an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime> interface from the service provider.
- Gets an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthCheckService> class from the service provider.
- Defines a delegate that will be invoked when the application starts, is stopping, and eventually stopsâ€”that requests the health check service to perform a health check and display the result.
- Registers the delegate with the `ApplicationStarted`, `ApplicationStopping`, and `ApplicationStopped` events of the `IHostApplicationLifetime` instance.
- Runs the application.

### Resource utilization health checks

To perform health checks on the resource utilization of your .NET apps, add a package reference to [Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.ResourceUtilization](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.ResourceUtilization). On an `IServiceCollection` instance, chain a call from <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.HealthCheckServiceCollectionExtensions.AddHealthChecks%2A> to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.ResourceUtilizationHealthCheckExtensions.AddResourceUtilizationHealthCheck%2A>. The following example demonstrates how to use the `AddResourceUtilizationHealthCheck` extension method to add a resource utilization health check to an `IServiceCollection` instance:

:::code source="snippets/health-checks/Program.cs":::

The preceding code:

- Creates a new <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.HostApplicationBuilder> instance.
- Adds resource monitoring by calling <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.ResourceMonitoringExtensions.AddResourceMonitoring%2A>.
- Adds a health check for resource utilization by chaining a call from the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.HealthCheckServiceCollectionExtensions.AddHealthChecks%2A> call to the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.ResourceUtilizationHealthCheckExtensions.AddResourceUtilizationHealthCheck%2A> extension method.
- Builds the `IHost` instance.
- Gets an instance of the <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.HealthCheckService> class from the service provider.
- Performs a health check and displays the result.
- Runs the application.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.ResourceUtilization` library assumes that the consumer will register the dependent call to <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.ResourceMonitoring.ResourceMonitoringExtensions.AddResourceMonitoring%2A>. If you don't register this, when resolving the `HealthCheckService` an exception is thrown.

## Kubernetes probes

The [Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Probes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Probes) NuGet package provides support for Kubernetes probes. This package is currently experimental and is subject to change.

It's intended to report health checks that align with various Kubernetes probes, for example:

- Liveness
- Readiness
- Startup

The library communicates the apps current health state to a Kubernetes hosting environment. If a process reports as being unhealthy, Kubernetes doesn't send it any traffic, providing the process time to recover or terminate.

To add support for Kubernetes probes, add a package reference to [Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Probes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Probes). On an `IServiceCollection` instance, call <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.Probes.KubernetesProbesExtensions.AddKubernetesProbes%2A>.
