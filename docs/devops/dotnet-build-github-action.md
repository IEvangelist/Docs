# Quickstart: Create a build validation GitHub Action

In this quickstart, you will learn how to create a GitHub Action to validate the compilation of your .NET source code in GitHub. Compiling your .NET code is one of the most basic validation steps that you can take to help ensure the quality of updates to your code. If code doesn't compile (or build), it's an easy deterrent and should be a clear sign that the code needs to be fixed.
